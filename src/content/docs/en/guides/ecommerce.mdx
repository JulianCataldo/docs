Astro supports several e-commerce options, from checkout links to hosted payment pages to building an entire storefront using a payment service API.


## Payment processing overlays

Some payment processing services add a payment form to allow your customer to purchase from your site. These can be hosted overlays or embedded in a page on your site. These may offer some basic customization or site branding, and may be added to your Astro project as scripts, buttons, or external links.

### Lemon Squeezy

Lemon Squeezy is an all-in-one platform for payments and subscriptions with multi-currency support, global tax compliance, PayPal integration and more. It allows you to create and manage digital products and services through your account dashboard and provides product URLs for the checkout process.

The basic [Lemon.js JavaScript library](https://docs.lemonsqueezy.com/help/lemonjs/what-is-lemonjs) allows you to sell your Lemon Squeezy products with a checkout link.

#### Basic Usage

1. Add the following `<script>` tag to your page `head` or `body`:

    ```html
    <script src="https://app.lemonsqueezy.com/js/lemon.js" defer></script>
    ```
2. Create an anchor tag on the page linking to your product URL. Include the class `lemonsqueezy-button` to open a checkout overlay when clicked.

    ```astro
    <a class="lemonsqueezy-button" href="https://demo.lemonsqueezy.com/checkout/...">
        Buy My Amazing Product
    </a>
    ```
#### Lemon.js

Lemon.js also provides additional behavior such as [programmatically opening overlays](https://docs.lemonsqueezy.com/help/lemonjs/opening-overlays) and [handling overlay events](https://docs.lemonsqueezy.com/help/lemonjs/opening-overlays).

### Paddle

Paddle is a billing solution for digital products and services. It handles handle payments, taxes, and subscription management through an overlay or inline checkout. 

[Paddle.js](https://developer.paddle.com/paddlejs/overview) is a lightweight JavaScript library that lets you build rich, integrated subscription billing experiences using Paddle.

#### Basic Usage

After your default payment link domain is approved, you can turn any element on your page into a trigger for a checkout overlay using HTML data attributes.

1. Add the following two `<script>` tags to your page `head` or `body`:

    ```html
    <script src="https://cdn.paddle.com/paddle/v2/paddle.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      Paddle.Setup({ 
        token: '7d279f61a3499fed520f7cd8c08' // replace with a client-side token
    });
    </script>
    ```
2. Turn any element on your page into a Paddle Checkout button by adding the `paddle_button` class:

    ```astro
    <a href='#' class='paddle_button'>Buy Now</a>
    ```
3. Add a `data-items` attribute to specify your product's Paddle `priceID` and `quantity`. You can also optionally pass additional [supported HTML data attributes](https://developer.paddle.com/paddlejs/html-data-attributes) to prefill data, handle checkout success, or style your button and checkout overlay:

    ```html
    <a 
      href='#' 
      class='paddle_button'
      data-display-mode='overlay'
      data-theme='light'
      data-locale='en'
      data-success-url='https://example.com/thankyou'
      data-items='[
        {
        "priceId": "pri_01gs59hve0hrz6nyybj56z04eq", 
        "quantity": 1
        }
      ]'
      >
      Buy now
    </a>
    ```

#### Paddle.js

Instead of passing HTML data attributes, you can send data to the checkout overlay using JavaScript for passing multiple attributes and even greater customization. You can also create upgrade workflows using an inline checkout.

## Full-featured e-commerce solutions

For more customization over your site's shopping cart and checkout process, you can connect a more fully-featured financial service provider to your Astro project. These e-commerce platforms may also integrate with other third-party services for user account management, personalization, inventory and analytics.


### Snipcart

Snipcart is a powerful, developer-first HTML/JavaScript shopping cart platform. You can use it to add custom e-commerce to any sites or web applications in minutes.

#### Basic Usage: `astro-snipcart`

This Demo uses the [astro-snipcart](https://github.com/Adammatthiesen/astro-snipcart) community package.

1. Install the package using the package manager of your choice:

    <PackageManagerTabs>
      <Fragment slot="npm">
        ```shell
        # create a new project with npm
        npm install @adammatthiesen/astro-snipcart
        ```
      </Fragment>
      <Fragment slot="pnpm">
        ```shell
        # create a new project with pnpm
        pnpm install @adammatthiesen/astro-snipcart
        ```
      </Fragment>
      <Fragment slot="yarn">
        ```shell
        # create a new project with yarn
        yarn add @adammatthiesen/astro-snipcart
        ```
      </Fragment>
    </PackageManagerTabs>

2. Add the environment variable for your Snipcart API Key
    ```ini title=".env"
    PUBLIC_SNIPCART_API_KEY=KEY
    ```

3. Make sure your snipcart [allowed domain](https://docs.snipcart.com/v3/dashboard/store-configuration#5-domains--urls) is configured for your web domain.

4. Add the `astro-snipcart` `<HeaderAstro>` component to your page `head`, for example, in a common layout file:

    ```astro title="src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro"
    ---
    import { HeaderAstro } from '@adammatthiesen/astro-snipcart';
    ---
    <html>
        <head>
        <!-- other header stuff --->
            <HeaderAstro />
        <!-- Rest of layout... --->
        </head>
    ```

5. Add a purchase button using the [`<SC.MakeProduct>` component with any desired attributes]() in your page template for each product.

    ```astro title="src/pages/productpage-1.astro"
    ---
    import * as SC from '@adammatthiesen/astro-snipcart';
    ---
    <SC.MakeProduct
        id="SKU-0001" 
        name="Example Name"
        price={ 12.99 }
        url="/store/example"
        description="Some Default Example Product"
        image="/Link/To/Image.png"
        >
        <button>Add to cart</button>
    </SC.MakeProduct>
    ```
